# Portfolio

**SYNOPSIS**

A mock webpage containing a portfolio of my completed apps and programs.

**PURPOSE**

This project's purpose was to test what I learned in the *Build a Portfoli*o section of Udacity's *Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree* program. I was given a design mockup and was asked to replicate that design in HTML and CSS.

For this project, I used the Bootstrap framework and created breakpoints to make the webpage responsive for all viewports. I also created modals using CSS & JavaScript. Lastly, I used Git/GitHub to keep track of my changes and Grunt to concatenate my JavaScript files.

**USAGE**
